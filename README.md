## Introduction

ChatBot Games is an online chatbot that acts as a text-based game platform. It was built to be a fun and interactive way to improve typing skills, expand vocabulary, and boost cognitive function. Users can use natural language to interact with the chatbot and request gameplay rules or begin play. It features a game selection panel, logs for each game, and a high-score display.

The site itself is hosted using the Flask library for Python. The frontend is written entirely in JavaScript, and the database of scores is managed using SQLite3. 

## Running CBG

To host the site locally, run ```chatbotgames.py``` from the command line. It will be hosted on port ```5000```. Please note that the site is currently configured to run in debug mode and should not be used in a production deployment without modifying the configuration.



## Implementing Custom Games
